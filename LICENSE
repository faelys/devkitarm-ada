  * `patch/*.diff`:
Original work by Natacha Porté, but probably too simple to be considered
IP. If it's not, it probably falls under `devkitARM` license, i.e. GPL

  * `patch/gcc-4.9.0.patch`:
This is mostly patches from `avr-ada` against 4.9.1, slightly adjusted to
fit in `devkitARM` build scripts. So I guess it's covered by `avr-ada`
and/or GCC license, so it probably amounts to GPLv3.

  * `rts/system.ads`:
This comes directly from `avr-ada`, but still include GCC headers, so I
think it's covered by GPLv3 with runtime exception.


That's a lot of guess work, but it's probably safe to consider everything
under the GPL except my stand-alone original work (which is definitely
under the ISC license).
